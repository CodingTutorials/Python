# Elif

> When you use a elif program, it tells the computer to do B instead of A if A is false

Write a if statement

```python
if a == "b":
```

Add "el" before the "if"

```python
elif a == "b":
```

It has the same format as the if function, so look at that tutorial for a more in depth explanation.
