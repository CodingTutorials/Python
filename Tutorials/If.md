# If

Write "if".

```python
if
```

Next, add a space and a variable.

```python
if apples
```

After that, add two equal signs.

```python
if apples ==
```

If you want it equal to a integer, add a space and the integer. If you want it less than or equal to, add the appropriate signs. After that, put a colon. If you want to view the variable tutorial, click [here](https://github.com/codingtutorials/Python/blob/master/Tutorials/Variables.md)

```python
if apples == 1:
```

If you want it equal to a string, add a pair of parenthesis and inside it, put a string. After that, put a colon.

```python
if apples == "alot":
```

Next, press enter and press tab. After that, put any code. In this case, I will put a print line. If you want to view the printing tutorial, click [here](https://github.com/codingtutorials/Python/blob/master/Tutorials/Print.md)

```python
if apples == "alot":
  print("You have",apples,"apples")
