## Print

Write "print".

```python
print
```

After that, add a pair of parentheses.

```python
print()
```

If you want it to print a variable, type the variable inside the parentheses

```python
print()
```

If you want it to print a string, put a pair of quotation marks and inbetween that, add a string.

```python
print("")
```
